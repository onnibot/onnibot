Initial setup
=============

This section will tech you what to do when setupping the bot.

Invite
-------

#. Open https://jcolour.jaqreven.com/invite
#. Click the server you want to use (and don't change permissions)
#. Invite the bot

Role Setup
-----------

#. Open the roles of your Discord server
#. Find a role named "jColour"
#. Drag it to the top of the roles list - it should be on top of even the admins. This is required for managing the roles of all users.
#. Remove colours from all roles (except ones you want to use for colours)
#. Save the roles.

Restricting to a role
---------------------

If you want to restrict all colours to a certain role:

#. Type j!set-role
#. Reply with the name of the role ("everyone" for no limits)
#. Done! Now only that role can access colours.
